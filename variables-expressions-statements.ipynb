    "Python is a well-known programming language, designed by Guido van Rossum at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in Amsterdam. The design of the language allows code to be organized into <u>reusable</u> and <u>self-contained</u> objects. Knowing the three essential data types—[String][string], [Integer][int], and [Float][int]—is important as they are fundamental for <u>representing</u> and <u>manipulating</u> data.\n",
