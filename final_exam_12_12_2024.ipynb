    "Imagine you're hired to build a password validation system for a major e-commerce website. Users are signing up in large numbers, and weak passwords are leading to account compromises. You have been asked by your manager to write a flexible password validator that enforces strong passwords while accommodating different policies for different regions (e.g., stricter policies in Europe, simpler policies in North America). \n",
    "\n",
    "The password validator must be able to perform the following checks:\n",
    "- Ensure the password meets a specified minimum length.\n",
    "- Verify that the password contains at least one capitalized letter.\n",
    "- Check that the password includes at least one special character.\n",
    "- Confirm that the password contains no spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the flexibility for handling regional differences the validator needs to be able to turn on or off these checks based on what is specified. This specification will be given in the form of a tuple, representing `(min_length, check_uppercase, check_special, check_no_spaces)` in this specific order. Where the minimum password length is indicated by an integer and a boolean is used for the other checks. For example, `(6, True, False, True)` means that the validator should check that the password is at least six characters long, has at least one capital letter, the presence of a special character does not need to be checked and it should be checked if the password does not contain spaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create this flexible password validator create a function `password_validator()`, with two parameters. A string containing the password and a tuple containing the checks that need to be applied. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever one or more checks fail the user should be notified. In your validator raise an exception for the failed checks with a specified message. The message for each failed check: \n",
    "- `\"Password must be at least {min_length} characters long.\"`\n",
    "- `\"Password must contain at least one capitalized letter.\"`\n",
    "- `\"Password must contain at least one special character.\"`\n",
    "- `\"Password must not contain spaces.\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure users donâ€™t get frustrated, your system should display all the issues with a password at once, only raising the exception at the end. Allowing users to fix all issues in one go. \n",
    "If the password passes all checks applied, the function should return `\"Password accepted.\"`\n",

    "You decided to create a digital card game.  First, you made the `Deck` class (see below) to manage the cards. Everything was going great, you implemented a method to build a standard deck of 52 cards, added a shuffle function, and a couple of functions to add and remove cards. Then it hit you: ðŸ’¡ **What if I want to manage a playerâ€™s hand or a discard pile?** \n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out, your `Deck` class isnâ€™t versatile enough for these other types of card containers (player's hand and discard pile). Instead of copy-pasting logic across multiple classes, you realized itâ€™s time to level up your design with **inheritance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "   Write a generic container for managing cards that both `Deck` and `Hand` can inherit from.\n",
    "   - Move the necessary methods from the old `Deck` class to this superclass\n",
    "   - Make sure that it follows the design above.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Re-implement the `Deck` class**  \n",
    "   You have to make changes to the `Deck` class you already have so that:\n",
    "    - It inherits from `CardContainer`.\n",
    "    - It functions exactly the same as the above example code.\n",
    "    - Avoid code duplication wherever possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create the `Hand` class**  \n",
    "   A sibling class to `Deck` that:\n",
    "   - Lets you assign an owner (e.g., `\"Alice\"` or `\"Player 1\"`) on initialization.\n",
    "   - Can draw cards from a `Deck` into the hand using a `draw` method.\n",
    "        - This method takes as parameters `deck: Deck` and `n: int`.\n",
    "        - It will move the top `n` cards of the deck to the hand.\n",
    "   - Implement a `__str__` method that prints the owner and all the cards in the hand.\n",
