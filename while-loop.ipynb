    "\n",
    "The [Collatz sequence][collatz], also known as the **3x + 1 problem**, is a well-known problem in mathematics. The sequence follows a specific set of rules: starting with any positive integer, if the number is even, you divide it by 2; if it's odd, you multiply it by 3 and add 1. You continue applying these rules until the sequence reaches the number 1. Strangely, when you apply these rules, you always end up in the loop of 4, 2, and 1—at least, this has been the case for all numbers tested so far—something that mathematicians still don’t fully understand or have been able to prove for all possible starting numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:darkorange;\"><strong>Level 1</strong>:</span> In this Python exercise, you will create a program to generate and display the Collatz sequence for a given starting number. You continue applying these rules until the sequence reaches the number 1. Your task is to implement a **while loop** to calculate the sequence and **break** the loop if it reaches 50 steps. This means that if the sequence does not reach 1 within 50 steps, the loop should terminate to prevent long-running computations and possible infinite loops (test this with the number 27 as this takes 111 steps to terminate). If you have to break add the print message:\n",
