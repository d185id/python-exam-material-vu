    "## <span style=\"color:#4169E1\">What is `class inheritance`?</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "[`Class Inheritance`][c] is one of the core concepts of OOP that allows us to establish a type of `\"is-a\"` relationship **between classes**. It enables us to create a **new class**, known as the `derived class` or `child class`, that inherits attributes and methods from an existing class, known as the `base class` or `parent class`. Think of it as a **family tree** where the child (derived class) **inherits traits (attributes or methods)** from their parent (base class), **but can also have its own unique characteristics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is Class Inheritance Useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Real-world Relationships:** Inheritance mirrors real-life relationships and hierarchies, making our programs intuitively easier to design and understand.\n",
    "2) **Code Reusability:** With inheritance, we can write a class once and then extend it in other classes. This reduces duplication and errors, making our codebase more robust and maintainable.\n",
    "3) **Transitivity:** Just like in a family tree, if a class B inherits from class A, all subclasses of B will automatically inherit from A as well. This chain can continue, forming a multi-level hierarchy.\n",
    "4) **Simple and Understandable Model:** Inheritance helps organize complex systems into hierarchies that are simpler to manage and extend.\n",
    "5) **Cost Efficiency:** By reusing code and simplifying extensions, inheritance can significantly cut down on development and maintenance costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sounds fun, righ? Let's see how we can implement `class inheritance` in Python.\n",

It's like saying, \"Hey, I may be a cat, but I’m a mammal first!\" This way, all the essential characteristics like `name`, `age`, and `habitat` are initialized just as they are for any mammal, making sure that our Cat isn’t missing out on any family traits.\n",
