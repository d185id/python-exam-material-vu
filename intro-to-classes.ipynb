    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that helps you structure your code by grouping related properties and behaviors into individual objects. OOP makes it easier to model real-world things in code, reuse components, and manage complexity. In Python, `classes` are the foundation of OOP, allowing you to create your own custom objects that have both data (attributes) and behaviors (methods).\n",

Now, we're going to bring all of that knowledge together in a new and exciting way. **Classes** are a fundamental part of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and will help you organize your code, making it easier to work with and more powerful. Think of classes as blueprints. Just like how a blueprint of a house lets you create many houses, a class in Python lets you create many similar objects.\n",
