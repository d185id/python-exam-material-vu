This happens because when we try to open a file, we’re really asking the **operating system (OS)** to locate the file by its name and ensure it exists. We use Python’s built-in `open()` function to do this. If the `open()` function is successful, the operating system returns a **file handle**, which in this case is the `_io.TextIOWrapper` object.
